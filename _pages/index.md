<p style="text-align: justify">
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group for Computational Methods for PDEs at the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/">Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics (RICAM)</a>.
Previously, I was a PhD Student in the group for Numerical Mathematics at the Technical University of Munich.

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify">
My research is driven towards characterizing, quantifying, and, ultimately, predicting natural phenomena by way of mathematical modelling.
Within this purview, numerical methods are indispensable.
Indeed, they <em>must</em> be used in order to make informed decisions and reach reliable conclusions when facing contemporary problems in science and engineering.
By employing mathematical tools from functional analysis, topology, differential geometry, and numerical linear algebra, the intent of my research is to develop the most accurate and practical numerical methods for modern scientific and engineering purposes.

### My research interests are:
- Well-posedness of nonlinear evolutionary PDEs with nonlocal, stochastic, fractional and/or mixed-dimensional features.
- Long-time behavior and regularity of solutions to PDEs.
- Numerical analysis of PDEs.
- Applications of PDEs, e.g., in nonlinear acoustics, fluid dynamics, and tumor growth modeling (corresponding to the images on the right hand side from top to bottom, respectively).

### Other notes:
- I still do finite element research! In fact, I'm an active [MFEM](https://mfem.org/) developer. Check out our (growing) list of examples codes and miniapps [here](https://mfem.org/examples/).
- This website has been tidied up a little bit. If you are interested in my old finite element work (2015-2020), short summaries can still be found [here](/research/).<br> -->
