I am an incoming assistant professor at the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University.
Currently, however, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Applied Scientific Computing at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where I am leading a three-year research project on PDE-constrained stochastic optimization methods for risk-averse engineering design.
<!-- Previously, I was a postdoc at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics at Brown University.
Before that, I was a postdoc at the Chair of Numerical Analysis at the Technical University of Munich, where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.professoren.tum.de/en/wohlmuth-barbara/">Barbara Wohlmuth</a>.
Before that, I attended the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/">Oden Institute</a>, at the University of Texas at Austin, where I earned my Ph.D. under the supervision of <a href="https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~leszek/">Leszek Demkowicz</a>. -->

My research is driven towards characterizing, quantifying, and, ultimately, predicting natural phenomena by way of mathematical modelling.
Within this purview, numerical methods are indispensable.
Indeed, they <em>must</em> be used in order to make informed decisions and reach reliable conclusions when facing contemporary problems in science and engineering.
By employing mathematical tools from functional analysis, topology, differential geometry, and numerical linear algebra, the intent of my research is to develop the most accurate and practical numerical methods for modern scientific and engineering purposes.

<p style="text-align: justify">
My work typically focuses on numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), but I also work on computational relativity, scientific machine learning, and turbulence modeling from time to time.

### Other notes:
- I still do finite element research! In fact, I'm an active [MFEM](https://mfem.org/) developer. Check out our (growing) list of examples codes and miniapps [here](https://mfem.org/examples/).
- This website has been tidied up a little bit. If you are interested in my old finite element work (2015-2020), short summaries can still be found [here](/research/).
