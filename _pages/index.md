<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
    I am a mathematician specializing in <strong>numerical analysis and the theory of partial differential equations (PDEs)</strong>, with a strong focus on applications in engineering and the life sciences. Currently, I am a project leader in the Computational Methods for PDEs group at the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/">Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics (RICAM)</a>. I obtained my PhD at the Technical University of Munich under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.cit.tum.de/math/forschung/gruppen/numerical-analysis/">Prof. Barbara Wohlmuth</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
My research combines <strong>rigorous mathematical & numerical analysis</strong> with the development of <strong>structure-preserving numerical methods</strong> for complex PDE models. Through my work, I contribute to bridging <em>theory and computation</em> in applied mathematics: ensuring that advanced PDE models are not only mathematically well-founded but also reliably computable and applicable to real-world problems.
