<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
I am a mathematician specializing in <strong>numerical analysis and the theory of partial differential equations (PDEs)</strong>, with a strong focus on applications in the natural and engineering sciences. Currently, I am a project leader in the Computational Methods for PDEs group at the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/">Johann Radon Institute (RICAM)</a>. Before that, I obtained my PhD at the Technical University of Munich in the group of Prof. Barbara Wohlmuth.  
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
My research combines <strong>rigorous mathematical & numerical analysis</strong> with the development of <strong>structure-preserving numerical methods</strong> for complex PDE models. In particular, I investigate stability, convergence, well-posedness and long-time behavior of nonlinear PDE systems arising in physics, biology, and engineering, and I design and analyze numerical schemes that respect the underlying qualitative properties of the equations.

Currently, I am a project leader in the Computational Methods for PDEs group at the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/">Johann Radon Institute (RICAM)</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
    My research integrates <strong>rigorous mathematical analysis</strong> with the development of <strong>structure-preserving numerical methods</strong> for complex systems. I am particularly interested in the well-posedness, long-time behavior, and numerical approximation of nonlinear PDEs with nonlocal, stochastic, or fractional characteristics.

    I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Methods for PDEs group at the 
    <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/">Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics (RICAM)</a>, currently applying for professorships in Numerical Analysis. My research program is dedicated to the development of rigorous mathematical and <strong>numerical analysis</strong> techniques for complex <strong>partial differential equations (PDEs)</strong> and their application to challenging problems in engineering and the life sciences.

    I completed my PhD in the Numerical Mathematics group of <a href="https://www3.math.tum.edu/m13/index.html.en">Barbara Wohlmuth</a> at the Technical University of Munich, where my thesis focused on the well-posedness of nonlocal and mixed-dimensional phase-field models for tumor growth.

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring, with a commitment to educating the next generation of applied mathematicians and engineers.
