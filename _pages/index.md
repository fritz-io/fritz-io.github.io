I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Methods for PDEs group at the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/">Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics (RICAM)</a>. 
I completed my PhD in the Numerical Mathematics group at the Technical University of Munich.

### My research focuses on:
- The well-posedness of nonlinear evolutionary PDEs, particularly those with nonlocal, stochastic, fractional, or mixed-dimensional characteristics.
- Examining long-term behavior and regularity properties of PDE solutions.
- Advancing numerical analysis techniques for PDEs.
- Applying PDE theory to practical areas like nonlinear acoustics, fluid dynamics, and tumor growth modeling (see images on the right, from top to bottom for each).
