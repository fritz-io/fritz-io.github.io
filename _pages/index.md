I am a postdoc at the Chair of Numerical Mathematics at the Technical University of Munich, where I am supervised by <a href="http://www.professoren.tum.de/en/wohlmuth-barbara/">Barbara Wohlmuth</a>.
<!-- Previously, I was a postdoc at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics at Brown University.
Before that, I was a postdoc at the Chair of Numerical Analysis at the Technical University of Munich, where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.professoren.tum.de/en/wohlmuth-barbara/">Barbara Wohlmuth</a>.
Before that, I attended the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/">Oden Institute</a>, at the University of Texas at Austin, where I earned my Ph.D. under the supervision of <a href="https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~leszek/">Leszek Demkowicz</a>. -->

My research is driven towards characterizing, quantifying, and, ultimately, predicting natural phenomena by way of mathematical modelling.
Within this purview, numerical methods are indispensable.
Indeed, they <em>must</em> be used in order to make informed decisions and reach reliable conclusions when facing contemporary problems in science and engineering.
By employing mathematical tools from functional analysis, topology, differential geometry, and numerical linear algebra, the intent of my research is to develop the most accurate and practical numerical methods for modern scientific and engineering purposes.

My research interests are:
* Well-posedness of nonlinear and nonlocal evolutionary PDEs.
* Long-time behavior and regularity of solutions to PDEs.
* Numerical analysis of PDEs.
* Applications of PDEs, e.g., in fluid dynamics, nonlinear acoustics, and tumor growth modeling.

### Other notes:
- I still do finite element research! In fact, I'm an active [MFEM](https://mfem.org/) developer. Check out our (growing) list of examples codes and miniapps [here](https://mfem.org/examples/).
- This website has been tidied up a little bit. If you are interested in my old finite element work (2015-2020), short summaries can still be found [here](/research/).<br> -->
