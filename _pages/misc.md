## Quotes that I like
- "As long as a branch of science offers an abundance of problems, so long is
it alive."  <br /> – David Hilbert
- "The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that
will allow a solution." <br /> – Bertrand Russell
- "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." <br /> – Albert Einstein
- "The analysis of PDE is a beautiful subject, combining the rigour and technique of modern analysis and geometry with the very concrete real-world
intuition of physics, biology, and other sciences." <br /> -- Terence Tao
- "I have no satisfaction in formulas unless I feel their numerical magnitude." <br /> – Lord Kelvin
