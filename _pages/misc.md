## Quotes that I like
- "As long as a branch of science offers an abundance of problems, so long is
it alive."  <br /> (David Hilbert)
- "The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that
will allow a solution." <br /> (Bertrand Russell)
- "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." <br /> (Albert Einstein)
- "The analysis of PDE is a beautiful subject, combining the rigour and technique of modern analysis and geometry with the very concrete real-world
intuition of physics, biology, and other sciences." <br /> (Terence Tao)
- "I have no satisfaction in formulas unless I feel their numerical magnitude." <br /> (Lord Kelvin)

Let $\Omega$ be a connected bounded Lipschitz domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Let $\mathcal{R}e>0$, $v_0$ be given in $H$ and $f$ in $L^2_{\text{loc}}([0,+\infty[,(H^{-1}(\Omega))^d)$; then there exists a pair $(v,p)$ defined on all $\mathbb{R}^+$ which is a solution of (V.1) and such that for all $T>0$, $$(v,p) \in (L^\infty(]0,T[,H) \cap L^2(]0,T[,V)) \times W^{-1,\infty}(]0,T[;L_0^2(\Omega)),$$ \( {% endraw %}|
